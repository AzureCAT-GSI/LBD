# LBD
## Library Based Deployment repository

This library is intended to host an Azure template solution that contains basic templates to be referenced on more complex template solutions, the concept is similar to Azure Building Blocks (https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki) but for more basic operations, like create virtual machines, change ip addresses from dynamic to static, assign DNS to a virtual network or to a virtual machine, etc. Azure Building Blocks goes beyond this and achieves more complex scenarios with less code through parameter files.

LBD is meant for those who still wants to simplify its resource manager templates and keep the same look and feel and full control of a template.
